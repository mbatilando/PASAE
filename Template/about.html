				<p><h3>Introducting PASAE</h3> <img src="images/pasaelogo.png" align="right" alt="PASAE" class="png"/>
				Established in 1988, the Pilipino Association of Scientists, Architects, and Engineers (PASAE) serves 
				as a close-knit support group for students in the technical fields, providing student members a space for 
				social interaction, cultural understanding, professional guidance, and academic support.</p>
				
				<h3>Academics</h3>
				<p>PASAE provides academic support through peer counseling, class advising, and various workshops. Our members 
				come from a wide variety of fields in engineering and science as well as architecture, and represent both 
				lower and upperclassmen. This creates a friendly and knowledgeable environment in which to seek advice 
				and guidance.</p>
				
				<P>We offer TeleBEARS class advising for both Fall and Spring semesters, study nights with refreshments, 
				workshops in office productivity software, website design, financial planning, and plenty of opportunities 
				to network with alumni.</p>
				
				<h3>Professional</h3>
				<p>PASAE offers industry field trips and various workshops on resume writing, career planning, graduate school 
				advising, and internship and cooperative education opportunities. Alumni speakers at our general meetings tell 
				us about their experiences as a Filipino/a in the “real world.” Furthermore, through the Student Alumni Mentorship 
				Program (SAMP), our members work with alumni to fulfill their personal and professional goals.</p>
				
				<h3>Social</h3>
				<p>As students of Cal, we know about tough times, screwed up schedules, incomprehensible professors, confusing 
				relationships, insufferable exams, impossible problem sets, slaving at the computer, and those late night studios.
				We recognize how important it is to have a life outside of class. PASAE organizes social events such as the famous 
				PASAE barbecues, Hip-Hop Classes, ice skating, broomball, clubbing, movie nights, game nights, and other forms of 
				stress relief.</p>
